# Web-Design-Challenge

Created a website for the summary of a project relating to the analysis of data regarding the comparison of city latitude vs. multiple variables. 
Included a home page for the site, pages for each individual analysis (and the accompanying visual/graph), a page containing all comparisons analyzed, as well as a page complete with a table of the data used in the analysis.
